      <h1>10/05: Object Oriented Programming</h1>
      <h2>DETAILS:</h2>
      <p>Welcome back!</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Share homework.</li>
        <li>Processing 6: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>HOMEWORK</h2>
      <p>Let's take a quick look at everyone's homework sketches</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Run your sketch on your computer.</li>
        <li>Use Sketch -> Present to hide the computer background.</li>
        <li>Make sure to upload it to your class Drive folder (link sent out this past weekend).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>PROCESSING 5: OBJECTS, ARRAYLISTS</h2>
          <p>NEW STUFF!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Defining Object classes</li>
              <li>Working with Object instances</li>
              <li>Object methods &amp; properties</li>
              <li>Object arrays</li>
              <li>Objects &amp; ArrayLists</li>
            </ul>
          
      <h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

    <div class="content">
      <h1>HOMEWORK</h1>
      <h2>HOMEWORK 6: ONE OBJECT, ONE ARRAYLIST</h2>
      <p>Create an interactive Processing sketch that...</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Uses at least one Object that you define</li>
          <li>Uses an ArrayList</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>PROJECT 1 (DUE 10/27)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Finally, the development to our research! Well, and maybe a little more research!</li>
        <li>For the first project, I would like you to work on a small personal project of your choice using Processing.</li>
        <li>You choose the project. I will not choose it for you.</li>
        <li>I'm open to *almost* any direction you might take, as long as it includes thoughtful use of Processing as a component. </li>
        <li>Feel free to explore the contributed libraries (Video, Sound &amp; Minim are recommended, but look deeper and see what you find). I am happy to provide you with some support as long as you start the research.</li>
        <li>Working with a partner is OK (recommended actually!), as long as the project reflects the combined effort of two people.</li>
        <li>Project presentations on Oct. 27th (The week after Fall Break).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>PROJECT 1 SCHEDULE</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Next week: The entire class is a work session. <strong>Sketches of two potential project directions due by the start of class next week (10% of project grade)</strong></li>
        <li>Two weeks: Fall Break</li>
        <li>Three weeks: Project presentations &amp; critique. Projects must be completed by 9AM (90% of project grade)</li>
        <li>Project presentations are MANDATORY. Grade penalties in effect for absences or lateness.</li>
      </ul>
