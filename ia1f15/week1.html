      <h2>PURCHASES</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>You won't need these until after Fall Break, but I would recommend purchasing them as soon as possible.</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Arduino UNO or Leonardo (with headers)*</li>
          <li>Make sure to buy the appropriate USB cable.</li>
          <li>Breadboard (small or large, but make sure it has power busses along sides). Like <a href="http://goo.gl/Tir7yh">this one</a>.</li>
          <li>Small storage box like <a href="http://goo.gl/40NHxk">this one</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Amazon is a (surprisingly) great place to buy this stuff, particularly if you have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/student/signup/info">Prime account</a>.</p>
      <p>
        Other options:
        <ul>
          <li>MicroCenter in Parkville (15 minute drive, but low inventory)</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a> (in New York)</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/">Sparkfun</a> (in Colorado)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>START HERE</h2>
      <blockquote>“Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”</blockquote>

      <h2>HOW TO GET WHAT YOU WANT</h2>
      <p>Some tips on getting what you want (from me...and beyond!)</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Listen.</li>
        <li>Ask questions.</li>
        <li>Practice (obsessively).</li>
        <li>Be brave (you will make mistakes).</li>
        <li>Be generous.</li>
        <li>Don't wait (keep going).</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>CODE</h2>
      <p>A few things about code...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We give instructions to computers using very explicit rules that we call "code".</li>
        <li>Code is programmed using programming languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages">There are a lot of them!</a>) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language">Not all are useful</a>) (Almost all programming languages are rooted in English, with <a href="http://nas.sr/قلب/">some exceptions</a>.)</li>
        <li>Programming languages are not communicative languages. We give specific commands following very strict rules already known to a computer. (Programming is quite bossy).</li>
        <li>Instructions used to solve specific problems in code are called algorithms.</li>
        <li>Bugs in code occur when commands are interpreted incorrectly.</li>
        <li>Code is an interface.</li>
        <li>Code is a material.</li>
        <li>Code is a tool.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>CREATIVE CODING, POETIC COMPUTATION</h2>
      <blockquote>"The main challenge is trying to create work that touches people at an emotional level, as opposed to them thinking about the technology or wondering how it was made. Making poems, not demos, is how we refer to it, i.e. making work that is like a poem, short yet dense, re-tellable, rhythmic, meaningful as opposed to a demo that just feels like technology for technology's sake."</blockquote>

      <h2>CODE IS SHAPING THE WORLD</h2>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENWVRcMGDoU">How Algorithms Shape our World</a> by Kevin Slavin

      <h2>PROCESSING</h2>
      <blockquote>"Processing is a programming language, development environment, and online community. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. Initially created to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach computer programming fundamentals within a visual context, Processing evolved into a development tool for professionals. Today, there are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning, prototyping, and production."</blockquote>

      <h2>BEFORE WE GET STARTED...</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Processing is quite unique, powerful, and a great way to learn how to program (especially as an artist or designer!). But...</li>
        <li>Processing is not a one-size-fits-all solution... It may not be able to scratch all of your code itches.</li>
        <li>The good news! Your first language is the typically hardest to learn. Much of the concepts and conventions carry over from language to language</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>PROCESSING 1: GETTING STARTED</h2>
          <p>
            Today, we'll be getting our feet wet with the Processing environment and language– drawing shapes, adjusting their attributes, and working with images.
            <ul>
              <li>Install Processing 3 (<a href="http://processing.org/download/?processing">link</a>)</li>
              <li>Tour of the programming environment</li>
              <li>Structure of a Processing sketch</li>
              <li>Running a sketch</li>
              <li>Understanding Processing's syntax</li>
              <li>Setting window properties</li>
              <li>Coordinates and positioning</li>
              <li>Shape primitive functions</li>
              <li>Adjusting attributes (color, fill, stroke)</li>
              <li>The sketchbook</li>
              <li>Using the <a href="http://processing.org/reference/">Processing Reference</a></li>
            </ul>

      <h1>HOMEWORK</h1>
      <h2>Homework 1: Translation/Composition</h2>
      <p>Use Processing to draw a static (non-moving) image.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Drawings can be representational or abstract. They can be improvised or based on observation. Let your own interests and curiosity define your aesthetic decisions.</li>
        <li>In addition to the things discussed in class today, I would like you to research and use something from either the Curves or Vertex subheading in the <a href="http://processing.org/reference/">Processing Reference</a></li>
        <li>We'll start class next week by taking a brief look at everyone's drawings.</li>
        <li>I will send everyone a link to their class Drive folder by the weekend. Please upload your drawing's sketch folder to the Homework/Week_1 folder by the start of class next week.</li>
